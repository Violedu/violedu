            Lesson Duration and Future Acceptance

          <div className={styles.text}>
            Each individual lesson has a duration of 45 minutes. Purchasing
            current lessons doesnâ€™t guarantee future enrollment. Decisions about
            subsequent lessons will be made separately.

          <div className={styles.text}>
            Students are expected to attend punctually and adequately prepared.
            This entails instrumental practice, ensuring a stable internet
            connection, functional audio/video equipment, a charged device, and
            having all necessary sheet music ready. If
            rescheduling a lesson is needed, the student should provide a
            24-hour notice. Recording lessons without consent or sharing
            instructional material is prohibited. Being late will not extend the
            standard 45-minute lesson duration.

          <div className={styles.text}>
            An invitation to an assessment session does not guarantee immediate
            enrollment into the program. This session provides an opportunity
            for the teacher to assess the student's proficiency level and ensure
            compatibility between the teacher's methodology and the individual
            needs and goals of the student. Its primary aim is to establish
            mutual understanding, thus optimizing the learning experience. The
            session will be conducted online and lasts for 30 minutes. Please
            note, the teacher reserves the right to decline enrollment if these
            criteria are not met during the session

          <div className={styles.title1}>Level Determination</div>
          <div className={styles.text}>
            Admission to the program typically requires a minimum of 10 years of
            experience playing the instrument, given the program's advanced
            level. Nevertheless, students with less experience are encouraged to
            apply and will be assessed during the free session to determine
            their eligibility for the program.

          <div className={styles.title1}>Payment Processing</div>
          <div className={styles.text}>
            By enrolling, you authorize us, or a third-party payment service, to 
            charge fees using your chosen payment method. If payments are processed 
            by a third party, you agree to their terms and conditions, and we are 
            not responsible for their actions or errors. The third-party processor 
            may share your payment information with us. We reserve the right to 
            change our payment processor or handle payments directly.

            You may need to provide credit card details to complete your enrollment. 
            By doing so, you authorize us to charge your card for your purchases. 
            Failure to process your payment does not release you from your obligation to pay.

          <div className={styles.title1}>Rescheduling</div>
          <div className={styles.text}>
            Any requests for rescheduling must be made with a minimum 24-hour
            notice. Rescheduled lessons should be within two weeks and subject
            to the Teacher's availability. Valid reasons for rescheduling
            include physical injury (supported by evidence), health challenges
            (with a medical certificate), or mourning. Failing to reschedule
            within the timeframe of 3 days, without valid reasons, will not be
            accommodated.

            Lesson Cancellation or Changes by Teacher
          </div>
          <div className={styles.text}>
            The teacher may need to cancel or reschedule a live or online lesson
            due to unforeseen circumstances or emergencies. In such cases,
            reasonable efforts will be made to reschedule the lesson at a
            mutually convenient time.

          <div className={styles.title1}>Ending the Agreement</div>
          <div className={styles.text}>
            The teacher reserves the right to terminate the agreement for
            several reasons including failure to follow the lessons guidelines,
            mistreatment, payment issues, behavioral concerns, or other valid
            grounds. In the event of termination for these reasons, the Student
            remains responsible for payment. No further monthly payments are
            required post-termination; however, any previously made payments
            will be retained as compensation for any inconvenience caused.

            All learning paths include a 14-day money back garantee. Refund
            request should be made within 14 days from the date of enrollment or
            purchase. The guarantee might apply to specific circumstances such
            as dissatisfaction with the teaching methodology, course content, or
            instructor interaction. The refund policy does not cover cases where
            a student has violated the terms of service or engaged in
            misconduct.
